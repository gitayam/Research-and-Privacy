# TOOLS and Packages used
## GPG Setup
- [gpg-provision](https://github.com/Logicwax/gpg-provision): easy interface for generating a full GPG keychain (Master CA key + 3 subkeys), generating backup files, revocation certifications, public ssh keys, and provisoning yubikeys/smart cards with these keys (one yubikey/smartcard for the CA master key to enable expiration bumping and signing others public keys, and another yubikey/smartcard to hold the 3-subkeys for day-today usage such as signing, authorizing, and decryption).
- [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/)
- [yubikey manager](yubikey-manager)
- [gpg-agent setup](): set up environment to work with yubikey for OpenPGP based SSH keys
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/): free email application thatâ€™s easy to set up and customize and works well with GPG and Yubikey
